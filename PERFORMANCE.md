# Performance — what's measured, what's not

mailrs's positioning is "modern Rust implementation of legacy email
protocols, performance-first". For that to mean anything, every number
that appears in a commit message, README, BUDGETS.md, or blog post
**must trace back to a measurement that anyone can reproduce.** Guesses
don't count. Estimates don't count. Numbers we'd like to be true don't
count.

This file is the source of truth for which mailrs perf claims are
honestly measured and which are still open. When in doubt, default to
the latest column ("Measured?") here — not to whatever a commit message
or marketing material says.

## Measured

### Workspace-level

| Path | Measurement | Run command |
|---|---|---|
| Release binary size (mailrs-server) | 44 MB (default) → 22 MB (perf-first profile). M-series Mac. | `du -h $TARGET_DIR/release/mailrs-server` before/after commit `9f21e0b`. |

### `mailrs-inbound` (criterion bench, M-series Mac, release, 100-sample median ± 95% CI from criterion's own analysis)

| Path | Median | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `decision::make_delivery_decision_greylist` | **2.4 ns** | trivial early return |
| `context::receive_context_to_pipeline_input` | **65 ns** | per-message snapshot clone |
| `pipeline_run/early_reject_short_circuit` | **201 ns** | first stage rejects → entire pipeline |
| `auth_header::format_auth_results_header_quadruple` | **228 ns** | RFC 8601 4-method header |
| `decision::make_delivery_decision_accept` | **337 ns** | Accept path + auth header build |
| `auth_header::build_auth_header_no_reason` | **342 ns** | DMARC pass header (no reason) |
| `decision::make_delivery_decision_dmarc_reject` | **408 ns** | Reject path + auth header build (header built even though not returned) |
| `auth_header::build_auth_header_with_reason` | **429 ns** | DMARC fail header with `reason="policy=…"` |
| `pipeline_run/4_noop_stages` | **610 ns** | framework dispatch cost only |
| `pipeline_run/realistic_mix_6_stages` | **648 ns** | dispatch + 6 cheap noop-style stages |
| `decision::make_delivery_decision_junk` | **735 ns** | Junk path — extra `format!` for score-breakdown reason |

Run: `cargo bench -p mailrs-inbound --bench pipeline` (the bench file
ships in `crates/inbound/benches/pipeline.rs`).

### Other crate-level perf gates (regression-catch only)

Each crate's `tests/perf_gate.rs` documents a budget per gated path and
runs as part of `cargo test`. These are *not* publishable numbers (the
gates have 15-30× headroom so they catch order-of-magnitude regressions,
not micro-perf swings). Don't quote them as performance claims; quote
the criterion bench medians above instead.

| Crate | `cargo test -p mailrs-<crate> --test perf_gate` | Gate count |
|---|---|---:|
| mailrs-clean | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 3 |
| mailrs-dav | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 3 |
| mailrs-dmarc | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 2 |
| mailrs-ical | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 2 |
| mailrs-imap-proto | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 3 |
| mailrs-inbound | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 8 |
| mailrs-intelligence | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 2 |
| mailrs-jmap | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 4 |
| mailrs-mailbox | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 8 |
| mailrs-outbound-queue | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 6 |
| mailrs-postmaster | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 4 |
| mailrs-rate-limit | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 4 |
| mailrs-shield | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 5 |
| mailrs-smtp-client | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 3 |
| mailrs-smtp-proto | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 5 |
| mailrs-maildir | budgets in `BUDGETS.md` | 3 |

### Server-internal (`mailrs-server`, gated `#[test]` bench)

| Path | Measurement | Run command |
|---|---|---|
| `extract_subject_and_from` vs. two `extract_header` calls | Single-pass wins **48-50%** across 1KB/5KB/20KB messages (release). Absolute: saves **2.0 / 3.1 / 6.5 µs** per message respectively. | `MAILRS_BENCH=1 cargo test --release -p mailrs-server bench_two_pass_vs_single_pass -- --nocapture --test-threads=1` |

## NOT measured (claims to retract or qualify)

These appeared in commit messages but were guesses. They are NOT
performance claims mailrs stands behind.

### Commit `9f21e0b` (perf-first release profile)

The commit message said "Conservative estimate: +10-20% throughput on
hot paths from cross-crate inlining alone, more on Result-heavy code
paths from panic=abort." **Not measured.** End-to-end mailrs-server
throughput before vs. after the profile change has not been
benchmarked. The binary size delta (-50%) IS real and reproducible;
the throughput delta is plausible but unsubstantiated.

To upgrade this to "measured": run a sustained SMTP-receive benchmark
(e.g. a `smtp-source`-style load generator at 1000 msg/sec) against
`mailrs-server` built with both profiles, compare 99th-percentile
delivery latency.

### Commit `501dd5e` (zero-alloc header scan)

The commit message said "~30-50% allocation reduction on the
header-extract hot path." **Not measured.** The number was an intuition
based on counting allocations in the diff (the fallback path went from
multiple `String` allocations down to zero on miss + one on match), not
a measured allocation profile (e.g. via `dhat` or jemalloc stats).

The structural improvement is real (fewer allocations on the byte-scan
fallback path), but the percent figure is unverified. The fallback path
also only runs when `mail_parser` returns `None` — which is rare.

To upgrade this to "measured": instrument `extract_header` calls with
`dhat::Profiler`, run a representative SMTP receive workload, compare
allocation totals before vs. after the commit.

### Commit `69beb4b` (pre-size recipient Vecs)

Commit message did not claim a percentage. The change is structurally
correct (avoids the geometric resize cascade) but the absolute impact
depends on recipient count distribution, which is not measured. For
typical 1-3 recipient messages the difference is below measurement
noise; for 50+ recipient bulk-mail it should be observable but isn't
gated by a benchmark yet.

## How to add a new perf claim

1. Write a benchmark. Either a criterion bench under `crates/<x>/benches/`
   (slow but rich output, run with `cargo bench`), or a gated `#[test]`
   harness like `bench_two_pass_vs_single_pass_extract` (fast, runs
   in `cargo test --release` with an env gate).
2. Run it. Capture the actual numbers (median over 100+ iterations).
3. Add the number to this file's "Measured" table with the exact
   `cargo` command to reproduce.
4. The commit message can then reference the number — and only the
   number that's in this table.
5. If the optimization is on the hot path and we want CI to catch
   regressions, also promote it to a `tests/perf_gate.rs` row with
   a budget at 15-30× headroom.

## What this discipline protects

The single worst failure mode for a "performance-first" project is
this: someone reads our commit history / README / blog, decides to use
us because of the perf claims, deploys, discovers the claims don't
hold under their workload. The reputational cost is asymmetric —
losing trust is much easier than rebuilding it.

So: every number in this file is a number you can reproduce. Every
number outside this file (in commit messages, READMEs, blog posts)
must point back to a row here. If it doesn't, treat it as folklore
and demand a measurement.
